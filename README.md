# Get-stock-price
I have made a gui interface to get real time stock price of any stock listed on any stock exchange in the world for this I have used **yahoo finance stock symbol** to get stock price, it is adviced to use only those.

Python libraries used:
1. Used BeautifulSoup and html5lib for web scraping.
2. Canvas from tkinter for making interactive interface.
3. Requests to check URL response.
